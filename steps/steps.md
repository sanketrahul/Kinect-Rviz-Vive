i) Setup vive_ros package (https://github.com/robosavvy/vive_ros) on the ubuntu workstation. Check HTC vive working. ii) Setup Rviz_vive_plugin (https://github.com/AndreGilerson/rviz_vive_plugin) which allows RVIZ to render to the HTC Vive. iii) Setup pcl_ros libraries Rough Idea of carrying out visualization: Currently, through pcl_ros libraries, we can visualize point cloud data to the desktop. We can leverage this technique to publish point cloud data through RVIZ on the vive node. This may need some code engineering for ROS on the vive_ros and Rviz_vive_plugin to work for our purpose. In theory, it looks possible to publish depth point cloud data to HTC Vive through RVIZ but it seems nobody has achieved till now.
